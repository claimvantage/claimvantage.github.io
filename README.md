# Welcome

At ClaimVantage we build native Salesforce apps, and while doing that work we have created some non-proprietary code
that we are happy to share. Those open source repositories are:

* [force-metadata-jdbc-driver](https://claimvantage.github.io/force-metadata-jdbc-driver/) - Full and detailed Salesforce database schema export via SchemaSpy
* [sfdx-jenkins-shared-library](https://claimvantage.github.io/sfdx-jenkins-shared-library/) - Simplifies Jenkins Pipeline builds that use SFDX and scratch orgs
